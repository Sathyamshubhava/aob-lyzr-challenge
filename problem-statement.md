## Agentic Orchestration Builder

(Think n8n, but reimagined for agentic, event-driven workflows.)

### üß© Problem Statement

Design and build a scalable orchestration platform that bridges the gap between deterministic workflows and non-deterministic agentic systems.

In modern multi-agent environments, actions and reasoning often emerge dynamically rather than following fixed DAGs. Your challenge is to create a system that supports both structured flow control and adaptive, agent-driven behavior, powered by an event-driven, stateful architecture.

The platform should enable looping, branching, and concurrent execution, include human-in-the-loop checkpoints, and offer complete observability and replay across each state.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Directions

Build an orchestration engine that unifies deterministic DAG execution with agentic, context-driven handoffs.

Design around events as the control plane ‚Äî where orchestration, communication, and recovery are all event-triggered.

Ensure persistent, replayable state management across long-running and distributed workflows.

Incorporate human review or intervention at any stage of execution, with smooth resume and rollback behavior.

Develop an interface for visual orchestration supporting drag-and-drop.

Prioritize scalability, resilience, and extensibility, making it easy to register new node types, agents, or tools.
